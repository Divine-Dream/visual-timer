# Visual Timer

I do not check GitHub regularly at all.
    If you want to get in contact with me about any plugins for any reason, add me on discord:

Visual Timer is a plugin that displays a countdown timer over the game itself.

The side panel is where you'll be actually configuring the plugin.

First, type in any name you wish the timer to be labeled as in-game. If this is blank, it will auto-fill to "Timer".

Then, input how long you want the timer to go for via the H(hours), M(minutes), and S(seconds) fields.

Thirdly, simply click Add Timer and the timer will automatically start counting down both in game and in the side panel.

You can shift right-click the timer overlay to start(or resume), pause, or stop(set to 0) the timer.

If you want to delete a timer, simply press the "-" button on the right side of "Active Timers" in the side panel.

As for the plugin settings,
    There are 6 different styles of alerts:
        Flash Text (Slow)
        Flash Text (Fast)
        Flash Whole Timer Overlay
        Flash Whole Screen (a red screen with opacity of around 35%)
        Rave Text (very flashy and fast)
        Rave Whole Timer (VERY flashy and fast)

There is also an alarm sound you can toggle on/off that repeats after a while until you remove the timer.

You can also choose to toggle on/off show expired timers.
    When a timer hits 0:00.00 it is "expired", and if you have this option disabled, it will go away visually, but still exist in the side panel.

The timer counts down in intervals of game ticks (0.6s), so if you set a timer for 4 seconds, it will actually start at 4.2s and go down in 0.6 increments.

Timers do not persist across client restarts.
